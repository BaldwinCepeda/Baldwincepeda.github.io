          I'm Baldwin, and I have a genuine enthusiasm for Blockchain and
          distributed systems. My passion extends to exploring various facets of
          this field, including the intriguing realm of MAXIMAL EXTRACTABLE
          VALUE (MEV) Bots. I find myself particularly captivated by the
          concepts surrounding Account Abstraction and the exciting
          possibilities it introduces with the alternative mempool. To foster
          knowledge sharing and promote learning, I actively disseminate my
          discoveries and insights through my newsletter. It serves as a
          platform where I consolidate and communicate the valuable findings I
          gather from my extensive reading and research. Additionally, you can
          explore a significant portion of my work on my Github profile. Feel
          free to join me on this exciting journey of exploration and innovation
          in the realm of Blockchain and distributed systems!
